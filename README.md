## Customs/traditions/practices
* Tipping
  * Standard (for restaurants): 15-25%
  * Counter service: 0-5%
  * Automatic gratuities: 18% to 20% of the bill
    * Often automatically added onto the bill for large parties, with more than 5 diners in the group
    * You cannot refuse to pay an automatic gratuity since the payment is a service charge
    * You can tip a few more dollars on top of that if the service is great
  * When you pay with a credit card, the process goes like this
    * You ask the server for the check (the bill in BrE) - see [Basic conversation](#basic-conversation)
    * You receive it, check the items, and put your card on it
    * The server will take your card and come back with a receipt and a pen
    * You write down the tip, do the math, and sign
    * Don't forget to take the receipt and/or a picture of it before leaving
* "Bless you"
  * After you sneeze, someone may say "Bless you"
  * The proper response is "Thank you"
* Riding shotgun
  * Riding in the front seat (when your friend is driving) is called riding shotgun
  * Claim the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun" when everyone is in view of the vehicle
* Happy hour
  * "Cheers"
* Barhopping
  * Definition: the activity of visiting several bars in succession, having a drink in each
  * Fun, but not recommended ðŸ˜º
* Online shopping and delivery
  * Packages are usually dropped off at the front door and a proof-of-delivery photo may be sent to you via the app
  * Some packages may be hidden in the carport (on the left of the house, behind the trash bins)
  * Packages with high value will require identification

## Basic conversation
* Asking for checks/receipts
  * Can I have the check/bill?
